# dsa4212-assignments
This repository contains some of the code I wrote for the assignments in DSA4212 - Optimisation for Large-Scale Data-Driven Inference.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
The goal of this assignment was to improve the accuracy of a CNN in classifying images to one of ten categories, subjected to a compute constraint of 1 GPU and 120 seconds of training time. We experimented with different network architectures, hyperparamters and data augmentation strategies. We managed to attain a test accuracy of 81.76%, an improvement over the baseline of around 68%. Within the folder are some of my code contributions to the project.

Libraries Used: Tensorflow, Flax, Jax, Optax
